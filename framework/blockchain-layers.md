description: The three layers of the DigiByte Blockchain

# Blockchain layers

## Applications

This is the top layer of DGB that most people utilize in everyday applications. DGB also provides the DigiAssets layer here to build on.

The Top Layer is like an App Store with clear real-world uses.





### DigiAssets

All types of Digital Assets can be created with the [DigiAssets protocol](https://www.dgbwiki.com/index.php?title=DigiAssets) on top of DigiByte.







### Decentralized Applications

DAPPS built on top of the DigiByte blockchain.







### Smart Contracts

Smart contracts that leverage the rigidity and security of the DigiByte blockchain.







## Public Ledger

_The digital asset layer is what incentivizes the security of the entire platform._

_The Middle Layer provides Security and Administration._

### _Digital Assets - DigiBytes_

A **digi**tal **byte** of data, a representation of larger data or a unit that holds value, and cannot be counterfeited, duplicated or hacked. DigiBytes can be used to secure value for _a variety_ things.







### Immutable Ledger

An immutable public ledger where all transactions of DigiBytes are recorded.







### Security

DigiByte uses five separate mining algorithms for security. New DigiBytes come from mining.







## Global Network Layer

_This is the bottom layer of the DigiByte that supports all infrastructure._

_The Bottom Layer provides Communication and Operating Procedures._

### _Core Communications Protocol_

A very low-level way nodes on the DigiByte global network communicate.







### _Global Network_

Hundreds of thousands of people running DigiByte software all across the planet.







### _Decentralized Nodes_

Any server, computer or mobile phone connected to the DigiByte network becomes a node that helps relay transactions.
