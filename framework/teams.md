# Community teams

## DigiByte Core team

_The Core Development team is focused solely on the development of the project & the Core Outreach team is solely focused on outreach together with the DigiByte Awareness team._

_Because DigiByte is not a company, marketing is being produced by different members of the DigiByte Community. Some are organized in groups and using their skills to create awareness and encourage adoption._ 

_Groups like DGBAT \(DigiByte Awareness Team\) & the DigiByte Foundation \(DF\) are a blessing for DigiByte.  
Because the community is growing we see these groups growing and improving, and more of these working groups will appear in the future._
