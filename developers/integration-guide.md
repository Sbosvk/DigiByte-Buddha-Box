# Integration Guide

## Thank you for your interest in DigiByte!

DigiByte is a 6-year old UTXO blockchain that started in 2014 with a focus on speed, scalability and security.

DigiByte is proudly not an ICO, and the small 0.5% pre-mine was given away completely to community members in full in the first 30 days of creation, in order to encourage adoption and full-node downloads.

DigiByte has no founders reward or block-fee, and although the founder is still actively engaged in DigiByte, any DigiByte held by him or other developers was obtained through purchasing on an Exchange, or mining on their own, just as any and all other users would. In addition, there is no individual that controls any significant portion of the circulating supply, such as the founder or developers. DigiByte is highly decentralized and fairly distributed.

DigiByte has a sound reputation both for its forward thinking and for its rapid responses to changing conditions. DigiByte was the first major UTXO blockchain to implement SegWit, several weeks ahead of both Litecoin / Bitcoin. Similarly, DigiByte was the first non-Bitcoin blockchain to implement a fix for CVE-2018-17144.

DigiByte is also the first major UTXO blockchain to implement the Dandelion privacy protocol with the 7.17 release.

DigiByte pioneered the DigiShield difficulty adjustment algorithm that is used in dozens of other blockchains, such as Ethereum, Zcash, Dogecoin and more. DigiByte was also the first blockchain to switch from a single algorithm to multi-algorithm for the increased security that 5x mining algorithms provides. DigiByte will also be pursuing ASIC-resistant algorithms throughout 2020 / 2021 through the likes of GPU and CPU-focused mining algorithms. DigiByte recently implemented Odocrypt in 2019: an FPGA-focused algorithm created specifically for DigiByte that changes every 10 days making ASIC creation pointless. Another solid first.

DigiByte mining is also highly distributed and the most decentralized PoW in the world. Unlike X16R, DigiBytes MultiAlgo implementation is not a selection of hashing algorithms in a pseudo-random manner, but rather the 5x algorithms each actively compete against each other to mine 20% of all blocks. This also further encourages the immediate processing of all transactions, due to other hardware vendors and types being used otherwise across all algorithms.

Finally, we want to welcome you to the global DigiByte community, and to thank you for taking the time to integrate with DigiByte. Our vast community is incredibly passionate about the DigiByte blockchain and we are sure that you will be too.
